<p>Welcome to this escape room! Some rules/observations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No puzzles require guesswork - there is never a need to brute force an answer. Some puzzles may not be solvable until later, though.</li>
    <li>Googling things is allowed, and indeed encouraged/expected!</li>
    <li>There's nothing hidden in HTML, URLs etc - everything you need will be visible on a page.</li>
    <li>Some puzzles will require parts given as rewards from earlier puzzles.</li>
    <li>Answers are not case sensitive, and spaces are ignored.</li>
    <li>The "reset progress" option will remove all submitted answers and restarts the room. Only use this if you want to start again from the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sense? Type "ready" if you're ready to go!</p>

    Here's some stuff for getting the answer right! I'm sure this'll prove to be useful?
